This is my basic directory for all matlab functions that are used to work with cortex and Neuralynx data files.
Files that work on Neuralynx files are prefixed by NLX_ and files that work on cortex files are prefixed with CTX_ .

OfficialNLXFiles and OfficialCTXFiles contain the official files from the company web pages. 
BasicFiles contain the extensions I made for making reading and manipulating the data easier. These files are general and not tied to any specific experiment or settings.
